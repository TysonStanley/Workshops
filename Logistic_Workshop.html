# The Probabilities

.large[Let's get mathy!]

$$
logit(Y) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

$$
log(\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)}) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

$$
\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}
$$

$$
Prob(Y = 1) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}
$$

# So...

.pull-left[
.large[.large[

1. Depends on all the estimates and values

2. Is not necessarily linear

# Average Marginal Effects

.large[.large[
Each individual in the model has a .coral[**marginal effect**] for each variable
]

- To get a representative estimate for the sample, let's take the average of the marginal effects
