.huge[Why even mention it?]

Mediation analysis has similar .dcoral[assumptions] to regression but they are somewhat more pronounced in mediation

# No Omitted Influences

.huge[
.dcoral[Two Main Principles:]
]

.large[.large[
1. If something is .nicegreen[related to X (or M) and Y], it needs to be in the .nicegreen[path b and c' model]
2. If something is .bluer[related to X and M], it needs to be in the .bluer[path a model]
]]

.large[
Example: If we are assessing religiosity (X) and heavy drinking behavior (Y), what are some variables that should be included?
]

---
# Slight Caveat

.huge[
.dcoral[*If* X is randomized] (e.g., treatment or control), then statistical theory says no other variables are related to X.
]

.huge[
But .bluer[we cannot randomize M] (at least in a single study) so even if we can get a causal relationship from X to M and X to Y, we cannot obtain causal M to Y.
]

---
# No Measurement Error

.huge[
Measurement error is always a problem (unless we use latent variable methods):
]
.large[.large[
- But can be .dcoral[more pronounced] in mediation analysis

  - If M has measurement error, it not only messes with M's estimate but also X's estimate

- Difficult to know in many situations how extensive measurement error is
]]

???
The other assumptions are all more like that of regression

# Two Frameworks

.pull-left[
## .dcoral[OLS/GLM Regression]

.large[
- Multiple regressions, fit separately and then combined
- Provides great flexibility (assumptions are lighter)
- Provides model fit for each sub-model but not the entire model

]]

.pull-right[
## .nicegreen[SEM]

.large[
- Multiple regressions fit simultaneously
- More restrictive assumptions
- Provides more information regarding overall model fit
- Mostly continuous variables (can handle binary, ordinal in some cases)

# Interpretation of Mediation

data.frame(
  Estimate = c("Individual paths", "Indirect Effect", "Direct Effect", "Total Effect"),
  What     = c("a, b, and c' paths", "a path estimates * b path estimates", "c' estimate", "a * b + c'")

# Complete or Partial Mediation?

.huge[
Many resources suggest ways of looking at this
]
.large[.large[
- I recommend not focusing on this but feel free to check
- Its based on whether `c'` is significant or not (while `a * b` is significant)

I think it paints an .dcoral[incomplete picture] of the model because:
]]
.large[
1. It only focuses on significance, not effect size
2. To really make this conclusion, we need really large sample sizes
3. It is almost always "partial" mediation
]

???
A better approach is looking at the effect sizes -- how big is the indirect effect size compared to the direct or total effect sizes?


---
# Continuous Mediators and Outcomes

.huge[
When the .nicegreen[mediator and outcome are both continuous] (an roughly normal), interpretation is straightforward
]

.large[
1. Paths are in terms of the corresponding endogeous variable's units
2. Indirect effects are in the outcome's units
3. Direct effects are in the outcome's units
4. Total effect is in the outcome's units
]

--
.large[
Example: If X is continuous, the indirect effect is 2.5, and the outcome is in quality of life rating, what is the interpretation?

# Use GLMs with Mediation Analysis

### But...
This presents a new challenge in interpreting the results


---
# Interpretation with Categorical Mediator/Outcome

.large[.large[
A few options:

1. Intepret the .nicegreen[individual pathways and note the percent of mediation]. This approach is commonly used in the literature.

2. New: .dcoral[Marginal Mediation Analysis]. Is being prepared right now (shows serious promise for these situations).
]]

---
### Interpret Individual Pathways

.large[Three Steps:
1. Fit individual GLM regressions for all pathways (`a`, `b`, `c'` and `c`)
2. Discuss basic effect size information for each pathway
3. Evaluate the change from `c` to `c'` as a proportion of `c` -- $\frac{c-c'}{c}$. This is a representation of how much of the total effect is mediated.
]

### Marginal Mediation Analysis

.large[
- Uses Average Marginal Effects
- Interpretation and steps for use are exactly like mediation with continuous mediators/outcomes (can interpet individual paths, indirect and direct effect sizes)
- Uses bootstrapping to get confidence intervals (recommended in most situations)
